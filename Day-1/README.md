DevOps Environments & EC2 Setup (AWS)

1. Development Environment:

A Dev Environment is used by developers to test basic or minimal implementations of the application.
Developers validate the initial version and basic functionality before handing it over to QA.
On AWS: You can set up a t2.micro EC2 instance running Ubuntu or Amazon Linux with Node.js, Python, or Java installed to simulate a dev environment.

2. Test Environment:

Handled by the QA/testing team to run functional and non-functional test cases.
Includes performance testing, load testing, integration testing, and system testing.
Tools like Apache JMeter or Postman can be used.

3. EC2 Instances:

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances are virtual machines in AWS.
You choose the AMI (Amazon Machine Image), instance type (e.g., t2.micro, t3.medium), configure security groups, key pairs.
Connect via SSH(Putty) and use it as your application server.

4. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
You can define subnets, route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, etc.
Use public subnets for web servers and private for databases.
